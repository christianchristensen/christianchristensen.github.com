<img src="/images/media_httpminenetorgb_wxGxF.jpg" alt="TS-7250 wireless hosting" />Here is the <a href="http://www.embeddedarm.com/epc/ts7250-spec-h.html">TS-7250</a> board for my senior design project - it seems to be a great little embedded ARM board with tons of functionality. What you see here is the board linked wirelessly over the network with control from a desktop in the background (this was before I messed up the boot config file). Another fantastic thing about this board is since it is running an embedded version of linux, it also has a pretty full version of Apache running. This has made wireless interfacing as seamless as it gets for such a compact system.
