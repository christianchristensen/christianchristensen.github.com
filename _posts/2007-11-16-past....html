I think that these technologies only provide a jumping board for the capabilities truly held within. On the note of VoiceXML, I want to do some research on how that might integrate with <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> (Open-Source PBX). The potential to have an almost completely free enterprise level phone service is pretty inspiring.

Additionally the functionality provided by "./ant clean" is nice too, now the whole project can be managed from a single (very powerful) multi-platform file. *SVG is <i>wacky</i> - no matter how many times you try or how many different browsers you try in SVG will never display the same way twice. Therefore, it has come to my conclusion that the use of an outside <b>standard</b> tool is the best decision - <b>batik</b> was the solution for this project. *Extra Jar files make a project huge: with the inclusion of batik the project size if 6MB; with the inclusion of ANT the project is a whopping 50MB - these sizes are not ideal, but considering the functionality these packages provide, they should also be considered great tools!<br /><hr /><br />Overall: This project has been a success and I cannot wait to add some more functionality to streamline the process.<br /><a href="http://minenet.org/upload/upload/final_project.zip">Final Project</a><p /></div><div class="name">Chris  </div><div class="mail">mine </div></div><br /><a name="Sunday, April 29th 200"></a><div class="dash"><div class="time">Sunday, April 29th 2007 5:17:43 PM</div> <div class="subj">Interesting info </div> <div class="mesg">Additionally, I wanted to share some neat aspects of how all of this project works. I am using a very neat toolkit from Bastik that allows some very powerful SVG manipulation, particularly in terms of how <i>good</i> the SVG looks on-screen. The toolkit also allows for the conversion from SVG to PNG, JPEG, etc. I am also using XSLT to parse the tree structure data, so the simplest information is sent between applications in a very clear fashion. A(BC) is a parent A with two leaf-children B and C - pretty impressive structure. This structure was used from an XML.com article about how to use XSLT to transform text data into anything. I am also using javascript to do some user interface stuff. This is from the fact that most of the GUI stuff that was planned in the beginning was <b>way</b> to heavily dependent on Java implementation, so much so I think the XML nature of this project would have been well watered down. Now...a report to finish.<br /></div><div class="name">Chris  </div><div class="mail">mine </div></div><br /><a name="Sunday, April 29th 2007"></a><div class="dash"><div class="time">Sunday, April 29th 2007 12:33:23 PM</div> <div class="subj">Project update </div> <div class="mesg">So, I have found a way to get my document to SVG then output it in a standard format (PNG) all while using scripting files to use it off line - this will be automated with ANT.

As a matter of fact the common thread of consistency lies in how the XML exchanges the data for the standards of this project. The Java front end (pictures coming soon) is the portion of user interface that generates the data necessary for graphical output. The middle data processing section is powered by the data structures that XML naturally conforms to (like the DOM tree for XSLT).<br />And this is what it looks like:<br /><hr /><br /><center><img src="/images/media_httpminenetorgu_fmgED.jpg" alt="Past..." /></center><br /></div><div class="name">Chris  </div><div class="mail">minenet </div></div><br /><a name="Sunday, March 18th 2007"></a><div class="dash"><div class="time">Sunday, March 18th 2007 12:27:26 AM</div> <div class="subj">Final Project ideas (like everyone else...) </div> <div class="mesg">I have been looking for a final project to work on for my XML class. I have contemplated several ideas, ranging from the SVG/AJAX implementation to GiZMO presented by Dr. Coyle, rewriting my web page to accommodate some modern web standards - XML, PHP, RSS (which will remain a project in the works), to the Master Feed statistics package - for telling the posting information to <b>all</b> of the blogs listed in a sequence (kind of like a metrics page for Google Reader - I have not seen it done yet). So, I have moved on to another neat idea that can hopefully help a friend of mine. For Mock-Trial meets there is some information that is kept from the teams to try an separate the team identities. However, the natural desire - and competitive edge - is to try and decode this order. Also, the teams compete in a bracket style competition (and power matching) so it helps to <b>see</b> the teams one has competed with indirectly. I think this will be a fun project because the logic is fairly straight forward. I am hoping this will allow me to explore some of the fine points of polishing up this project - especially the user interface parts. I also think I will be able to use some pre-existing libraries to complete some of the more complicated aspects (such as drawing tree structures). I believe the incorporated technologies will include (many XML related): SVG, Java, Ant (for versioning and compiling all different libraries at once), XSL, CSS, XHTML, Swing, and many many more ((infomercial like)). Picture of what I will try to make the end result look like, soon to come...<br /></div><div class="name">Chris C  </div><div class="mail">minenet </div></div><br /><a name="Wednesday, February 28th 2007"></a><div class="dash"><div class="time">Wednesday, February 28th 2007 12:48:33 AM</div> <div class="subj">Incredible... </div> <div class="mesg">Not much else to describe this, except I am ready!<br /><a href="http://www.scottmcleod.org/didyouknow.wmv">Did You Know - WOW</a><br /></div><div class="name">Chris C  </div><div class="mail">minenet </div></div><br /><a name="Tuesday, February 27th 2007"></a><div class="dash"><div class="time">Tuesday, February 27th 2007 01:41:09 AM</div> <div class="subj">So it\'s been a while, but here\'s what we got! </div> <div class="mesg">So, I have recently been enamored with Yahoo\'s \"Pipes\" system (<a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Pipes.yahoo</a>).

Now from there we have the elegant RoombaVac - I will have to say this is one of the most satisfying devices ever - it just works. The floors feel cleaner the robot works when you are away and cleanup is easy, good going for the folks over at <a href="http://www.irobot.com/">iRobot</a>.<br />I was inspired to take a video of the plane landing for various reasons - one being that I have never seen a video of a plane landing posted on the web (granted I have not looked). The video of the waterfall is hard to explain, the effect is barely visible in the video but the water looks like it is trickling very slowly in sheets - it is one of the coolest things I have seen done with water (I also discovered that all they do is run water down a long screen to get this effect). And last, but most certainly not least, the monitor implosion. One day I was pondering whether a monitor would implode or explode upon a strong impact. Now rather than do internet research I figured a real life test was in order: all you need to perform this experiment is a monitor (old, unplugged, etc..etc), a heavy blunt object (ie sledgehammer, baseball bat, or in my case a heavy rake) and eye protection. I am going to neglect to explain what happened as the videos speak for that, but as far as I can tell monitors should implode-see for yourself. Man thatÂ’s some cool stuff-watch the videos.<br /></div><div class="name">Chris  </div><div class="mail">chris  </div></div><br /><a name="Monday, June 21st 2004"></a><div class="dash"><div class="time">Monday, June 21st 2004 09:04:05 PM</div> <div class="subj">movies </div> <div class="mesg"><img src="/images/media_httpminenetorgu_IBFvz.jpg" alt="Past..." /><br /><a href="http://minenet.org/upload/upload/MOV00023.MPG">MOV00023</a> |<b>::  </b>| do monitors explode or implode - take a look<br /><a href="http://minenet.org/upload/upload/MOV01046.MPG">MOV01046</a> |<b> :::</b>| video of a plane landing - now we can see it<br /><a href="http://minenet.org/upload/upload/MOV01047.MPG">MOV01047</a> |<b> :::</b>| another video of a plane<br /><a href="http://minenet.org/upload/upload/MOV01066.MPG">MOV01066</a> |<b>: ::</b>| a cool looking waterfall - makes the water look like its trickling continuously<br /></div><div class="name">Chris  </div><div class="mail">chris  </div></div><br /><a name="Saturday, June 19th 2004"></a><div class="dash"><div class="time">Saturday, June 19th 2004 01:27:23 AM</div> <div class="subj">more pictures </div> <div class="mesg"><img src="/images/media_httpminenetorgu_yJBED.jpg" alt="Past..." /><br />"oops I did it again" - whatev<br /></div><div class="name">Chris  </div><div class="mail">chris  </div></div><br /><a name="Friday, June 18th 2004"></a><div class="dash"><div class="time">Friday, June 18th 2004 10:06:38 PM</div> <div class="subj">Yahoo mail!!! </div> <div class="mesg">I have found myself excited about finding new emails, but I became even more excited when I found out that yahoo now gives away so much space with their premium accounts.<br /><img src="/images/media_httpminenetorgu_tBlgf.png" alt="Past..." /><br /></div><div class="name">Chris  </div><div class="mail">chris  </div></div><br /><a name="Thursday, June 17th 2004"></a><div class="dash"><div class="time">Thursday, June 17th 2004 06:05:02 PM</div> <div class="subj">New and Improved </div> <div class="mesg">seems like everything is new and improved these days...including my website and this other really <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=o0danibella0o">awesome</a> one.

This, by the way, is a great way to reduce fractions: x=(.6969696969), 100x = (69.6969696969). 100x-x=(69.6969696969)-(.6969696969) or x = 69/99.
