<p><img title="3086495495_ab338eecc4.jpg" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3066/3086495495_ab338eecc4.jpg" height="130" alt="3086495495_ab338eecc4.jpg" width="200" />&nbsp;Recently ran into an interesting problem - I wanted to move a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">content type (cck)</a> that I had created from one <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">feature</a> to another (specifically to move it into a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/spaces">spaces</a> enabled&nbsp;feature to gain some of those benefits - thanks <a href="http://code.developmentseed.org/">devseed</a>!); however, as you might be aware (if you are stumbling across this) features is pretty smart - often *too* smart.&nbsp;When removing the content type from one feature it will effectively remove the content type from your drupal install; whilst if you add the content type to another feature in parallel features will ingeniously mark the other feature you have as a dependency. What we are going to exploit: drupal features caches with a version control system (VCS - I prefer <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>) and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">drush</a>:</p>
<p />
<div>vernacular:</div>
<div>* laterBranchOrTag - the later time we are trying to get to in our source</div>
<div>* earlierBranchOrTag - the time when our feature we are coming *from* was correct</div>
<div>* featureNameOld = old feature (to delete from)</div>
<div>* featureNameNew = new feature (to be added to)</div>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/403176.js"></script></p>
<div>What we have done - we have basically loaded many of drupal's caches (note: some items like variables, with strongarm, do not use the db for cacheing - this is a different animal)&nbsp;with the feature and CCK defs and then switched the code base beneath it. When the features-update occurs the items that are cached are written out into features code, but in the featureNameNew namespace.</div>

<div>simple enough?</div>
