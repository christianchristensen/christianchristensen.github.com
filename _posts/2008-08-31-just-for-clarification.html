<div style="text-align: left;"><img src="/images/media_httpminenetorgb_irJqh.png" alt="Just for clarification" /><p /><br />Perhaps mostly motivated by my little understanding of how changes in gas prices, stock prices, futures, etc... I am a little baffled by how a change works:<br /></div><br />Interesting how the change in gas prices stocks or whatever is a rate. But given this rate, we are not given the time frame which tells you how the change in meaningful. I guess there is a chance that implicit knowledge of how a rate mechanism is always assumed.
