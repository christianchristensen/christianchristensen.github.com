<p>One of the things I want to try and do is establish a sort of journal from my digital breadcrumbs. I have gone through <a href="http://minenet.org/past/">several revisions</a> of blogging software and have had some difficulty consolidating my past entries of all of the blogs. Therefore, I have tried to consolidate and enable searching on this revision. As much of the information I could find I posted - archive.org was a great help in discovering my <a href="http://minenet.org/past/">digital past</a>.<p /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/media_httpminenetorgb_ryvvj.jpg" alt="Past Entries Updated" /><br /><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://minenet.org">archive.org (minenet.org)</a></div>
<p><br />(I also hope to make a visual portfolio of my front page eventually - I found it quite amazing that I have been maintaining minenet.org since 2001 - Celebrating 7 years!!!)<p /></p>
