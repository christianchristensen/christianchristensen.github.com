Charlie Wilson's War:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-size: 85%;">Charlie Wilson: You mean to tell me that the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan is to have the Afghans keep walking into machine gun fire 'til the Russians run out of bullets?<br />Gust Avrakotos: That's Harold Holt's strategy, not U.S. strategy.<br />Charlie Wilson: What is U.S. strategy?<br />Gust Avrakotos: Most strictly speaking, we don't have one. But we're working on it.<br />Charlie Wilson: Who's 'we'?<br />Gust Avrakotos: Me and three other guys.<p />(<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472062/quotes">many others</a>)<br /></span></blockquote>
