[SouthEast LinuxFest 2014](http://www.southeastlinuxfest.org), Videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/southeastlinuxfest
Nice recap by Jupiter Broadcasting (~@42 min): http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/60412/southeast-linuxfest-highlights-las-318


### SQLite as an Application File Format - Richard Hipp


*  "Representation Is the Essence of Programming" -Frederick Brooks (Mythical Man Month)
*  ["SQLite is not designed to replace Oracle. It is designed to replace fopen()."](http://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html)
*  ["Data lasts longer than code."](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/c9/6e/db/c96edb1f57ceff741f1d5501717e39bc.jpg)

Side notes:

*  [SQLite Archiver](http://sqlite.org/sqlar/doc/trunk/README.md)
*  [Fossil SCM](http://www.fossil-scm.org) - very similar to Git in concept (distributed VCS), but keeps everything in one SQLite file. Also, only a single binary that supports built-in wiki, issue tracking, and basic GUI functions. Ultimately it allows for some some nice semantics like: `SELECT DISTINCT name FROM users;` (rather than shell ginsu).


### Slackware ragchew - David Cantrell

(http://www.slackware.com, http://www.burdell.org)

*  Still alive and an impressive South-East Linux sub-culture.
*  Fascinating history and interaction during the Linux "boom" (many trade shows!) with Sun, FreeBSD, and ultimately [Walnut Creek CDROM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut_Creek_CDROM) (later BDSi, then Wind River Systems, then iXsystems)
*  Slackware was the first "live boot" (see also zipslack)
*  Version control regrets -- would have been great to see the evolution, but it's lost.
*  Suse - dev's mail spool file made it onto a distro release (wild west of builds and Linux)
*  As a community we could do better... packaging is a great example (every distro has their own) 
*  Hallway track: awesome history of [tz database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database) (note: this was needed for his own distro as glibc? stopped pulling in the latest for static builds, which required distros to manage the dependency) - "Time (and timezones) are both technical and political."


### PBI v10: Application Management Made Easy - Ken Moore

AppCafe

*  Wiki as data-source for rating system
*  runs pkgng through a series of shell scripts and parses the output for the GUI utilities (Qt)

[PCBSD](http://www.pcbsd.org/en/utilities)

*  Modified GRUB to support full disk encryption with ZFS
*  [Life Preserver](http://wiki.pcbsd.org/index.php/Life_Preserver/10.0) takes a snapshot prior to upgrade so that in the instance of a reboot and fail you can rollback.
*  Errata: Ken Moore is Kris Moore's brother, [BSDNow.tv](http://www.bsdnow.tv)


### ZFS 101 - Dru Lavigne

*  [Becoming a ZFS Ninja](https://blogs.oracle.com/video/entry/becoming_a_zfs_ninja)
*  [Open ZFS office hours](http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Events)
*  Encryption: [GELI](http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/disks-encrypting.html), [PEFS](http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/pefs)
*  Other
   *  [ZFS (on Linux) - use your disks in best possible ways](http://www.slideshare.net/dpavlin/cuc2013-zfs)
