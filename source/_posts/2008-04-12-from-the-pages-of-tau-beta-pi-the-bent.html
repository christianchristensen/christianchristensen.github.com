<blockquote><span style="font-size: 85%;">Realizing he was lost, a balloonist dropped down to ask directions.<p />"Excuse me, but I'm a little off course," he shouted. "I promised to meet a friend an hour ago. I don't know where I am."<p />A woman yelled back, "You're in a hot air balloon hovering approximately 30 feet above the ground. You're at exactly 37 degrees, 24 minutes and 26.16 seconds North latitude and 122 degrees, 8 minutes and 42.3 seconds West longitude."<p />"Amazing," the balloonist replied. "You must be an Engineer!"<p />"I am," she replied. "How did you know?"<p />"Well, everything you told me is technically correct, but I can't use your information. I'm still lost, and you haven't been much help at all. If anything, you've delayed my trip."<p />The woman thought for a moment, and then replied, "You must be in Management."<p />"I am," replied the balloonist, "but how did you know?"<p />"Well, you don't know where you are or where you're going. You've risen to your position due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect people beneath you to solve your problems. In fact, you're in exactly the same position you were before we met, but somehow it's now my fault."</span></blockquote> What a great story!
